<h2>## About Me:</h2>
<p>
 <h3> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I'm Mourad (just a simple persone) with a great passion to all thing related to IT, and electronics from a very young age. I'm a drop-out CS (computer science) student from <a href="https://aui.ma/" target="_blank"> AUI </a> after 2y and half due to many pointless courses for me out of IT field. Also, I didn't had time to self-learn side time during the accademia. Currently, I have just started self-learning in IT and trying harder while navigating through life. <br>
</p>
<p>
   &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; So, I have chosen to self-learn and focus on growing my knowledge until I become a skillful in software development, and finding weaknesses in code.
